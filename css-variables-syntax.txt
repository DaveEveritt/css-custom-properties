# :root can be used to declare CSS variables

in case anyone finds this old question and needs the information, `:root` is often used to declare CSS Custom Properties or "variables" that become available throughout the document, for example:

    :root {
      --darkGreen: #051;
      --myPink: #fce;
    }
    
    section {
      color: var(--darkGreen);
      background: var(--myPink);
    }

    article h3 {
      color: var(--darkGreen);
    }

Exciting, yes? Especially as not limited to colours, or to the `:root` selector. Bad: no IE support, but Edge is taking over, so let's wait for IE to die completely or use a fallback.
